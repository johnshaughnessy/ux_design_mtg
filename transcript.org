Greg: We have a few things to figure out.
These 3DOF controllers are in a couple categories:
- Ones that have a trigger
- Ones that don't have a trigger
And a third category, if you like:
- Magic leap has a trigger and a non-depressable touchpad.
 
Dom : Oh my god, are you serious?

Greg : Yes

Dom : Does it have a trigger though?

John : You can still click it.

Kevin : Nonono it's still clickable.

John : It's just not depressing.
